    Each week we bake a different variety of sourdough bread, so there’s often something new to try. Follow our
    <a href="https://instagram.com/olivestreetbread" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>
    for the latest bake announcements and pickup updates.

    All loaves are approximately 900g unless otherwise noted. We use long, slow fermentation to build deep flavour
    and an open, chewy crumb.

    Note: this is a home kitchen. Bread is prepared in the same kitchen as other foods and may not be suitable for
