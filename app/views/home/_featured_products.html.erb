      Each week we bake a different variety of sourdough bread, so there’s often something new to try. Follow our
      <a href="https://instagram.com/olivestreetbread" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>
      for the latest bake announcements and pickup updates.
    </p>

    <p>
      All loaves are approximately 900g unless otherwise noted. We use long, slow fermentation to build deep flavour
      and an open, chewy crumb.

      Note: this is a home kitchen. Bread is prepared in the same kitchen as other foods and is not suitable for
      people with severe allergies.
